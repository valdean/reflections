What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a .git folder in your directory for storing version control info. Otherwise, there's no place to track the changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area only includes the files you want to commit to the repo, not all of the files in the working directory. This allows you to conceptually bundle updates by file rather than update all changes to all files at once.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	By only adding the files relevant to that change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	When you make an experimental change. Branches all you to make changes without affecting the main git log and codebase.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	They show all the branches and commits in a linear, easy to scan graph.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	The two code bases are combined into a single code base. 

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	The pros are that it's fast and easy vs doing it by hand, but the con is that you don't look at each change manually to make sure it makes sense.
